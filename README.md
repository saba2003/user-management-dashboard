### User Management Dashboard

## Overview

  

This project is a **User Management Dashboard** built with **Angular 19**, **PrimeNG**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides functionalities for user registration, authentication, role-based access control, user profile management, and admin functionalities such as user CRUD operations.

The application also implements **guards** for authentication and role-based access, making sure that only authorized users can access the appropriate pages.


## Design choices

- **Navbar abscence**: for simplicity and more intuitivity there's a simple dropdown on the dashboard instead of a navbar/sidebar

- **Simple user management**: admins see all the users and can interact with them: view details, edit, delete

- **Non-admin users**: Non-admin users do not see other users and can only interact with their own profile details and if they try to navigate to other routes they are rerouted back.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register using a form with username, email, and password.

- **Login & Logout**: A login form that allows registered users to sign in and navigate through the dashboard.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The app differentiates between `admin` and `user` roles, where only admins can manage users.

- **User Profile**: Each user has their own profile page that they can view and edit.

- **User Management for Admins**: Admin users can view, edit, and delete users.

- **Guard-based Navigation**: The app ensures proper access control with guards like `authGuard`, `adminGuard`, and `userGuard`.
  

## Architecture

  

- **Component-based Architecture**: Components are designed to follow Angularâ€™s modular system. Each feature (user list, user details, etc.) has its own component.

- **Service Layer**: Services like `UserService` handle all interactions with backend APIs and data storage.

- **Routing**: Angular's **Router** handles navigation between pages. Guards are used to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Reactive Forms**: Angular's `ReactiveForms` are used to handle form validations for user registration, login, and profile update.


## Technologies Used

  

- **Angular 19**: The front-end framework for building the single-page application (SPA).

- **PrimeNG**: A UI component library for Angular.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.

- **RxJS**: Reactive programming library for managing asynchronous operations.

- **HTTPClient**: Used to communicate with the backend API.
